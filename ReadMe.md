# R library swissMrP

This package allows users to employ multilevel regression with post-stratification (MrP) to estimate cantonal-level support in Switzerland. The package was written to support my teaching at the University of Zürich. An earleier version was named *MrPzurich2013*.
The current version does not cover MrsP (multilevel regression with synthetic post-stratification).

## Installing the swissMrP library

You can install the package directly from GitHub using these commands in R:

```r
library(devtools)
install_github(“lleemann/swissMrP”)
```
